# Password Generator

# Description

This project was created to make a proficient Password Generator

I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the website page. 

There is also a gitignore and a few images for the Application. 

Creating the script.js file was the main challenge in this project, 

but was able to be overcome with a lot of attention to detail.

# How to Use project
You are taken to a landing page that includes the text box for the Password Generator.
Here you click on the Generate Password button, and are taken through a few different 
modal pages that prompt you on how you'd prefer your password to be made. The end results with a
select password with all the features you picked in the promts provided.
